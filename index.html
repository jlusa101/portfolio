        <p>
            My name is Joona Lusa, and I am a full-stack developer in training attending University of Toronto to obtain my certificate. In addition, I possess a Software Engineering Technician diploma from Conestoga College. I currently reside in Kitchener, Ontario
            but enjoy travelling all over the world. Originally from Finland, I moved to British Columbia, Canada in 2008 with my immediate family. On me spare time, I enjoy talking walks with my dog Bobo, playing basketball, and watching horror movies/tv-shows.

            My interest in coding sparked in high school when I took my first computer programming course but was interrupted when I moved from BC to ON. I didn’t pick up coding until years later when I had already graduated high school. After working in automotive
            and security industries, I decided to go back to school and start coding again. Since then, I’ve been continuously learning about new and evolving technologies that surround us everyday on the web. While attending Conestoga College, I discovered
            that I enjoy working with web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and many others. My career objective is to be a full-stack developer by the time I complete my program at the University of Toronto.
